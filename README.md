## Project: Bike-Traffic
This is the final project for my Python for Data Science class. The objective was to find answers to to three different questions by implementing machine learning algorithms. The three questions: choose three bridges out of four to install sensors to estimate overall traffic, predict the number of bicyclists on a particular day using the weather forecast, and to predict whether or not it was raining on a particular day The first question was answered by looking at the average bike traffic on weekdays, weekends, and overall. The higher the average the more popular the bridge is and therefore installing a sensor there would be most appropriate The second question was answered by using linear, polynomial, and ridge regression since the model can predict a numerical value based on numerical factors (i.e. temperature, precipitation, etc.) The third question was answered by using classification techniques such as logistic regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine, to determine if it will rain or not based on the precipitation ranges

# Final Project
## Due: 08.03.2020 11:59 ET

Up until now, we have given you fairly detailed instructions for how to design data analyses to answer specific questions about data -- in particular, how to set up a particular analysis and what steps to take to run it. In this project, you will put that knowledge to use!

Put yourself in the shoes of a data scientist being given a data set and asked to draw conclusions from it. Your job will be to understand what the data is showing you, design the analyses you need, justify those choices, draw conclusions from running the analyses, and explain why they do (or do not) make sense.

We are deliberately not giving you detailed directions on how to solve these problems, but feel free to come to office hours and lab hours to brainstorm.

The final project is due Monday August 3rd at 11:59 PM ET.

## Objectives

There are three possible paths through this project :

1. You may use data set #1, which captures information about bike usage in New York City. See below for the analysis questions we want you to answer.
2. You may use data set #2, which captures information about student behavior and performance in an online course. See below for the analysis questions we want you to answer.
3. You may sign up for the Purdue Iron Hacks Covid19 dataset initiative and fill up this form linked [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelfanHiXGrHqNrwTQdtC3EqVXP4lu0O79dS__2udz74gSoeA/viewform)

The choice of path will not determine your grade. Please note path 3 is an individual effort project (you may not have a partner in your team for this).

## Partners

On this project **you may work with one partner** (except for Path 3). Working with a partner is optional, and working with a partner will not impact how the project is graded. If you want to work with a partner, it is your responsibility to pair up; feel free to use Piazza's "Search for Teammates" feature to facilitate this.

If you are working with a partner, _you must share a repository_. This means that one of you will clone your repository on GitHub classroom, and the other will join this team (rather than cloning a second repository). When you go through the normal steps for cloning your repository you will have an opportunity to join an existing team (i.e., your partner has already created a group) or create a new team (i.e., your partner hasn't set up their repository yet).

_If you plan to team up with someone who has already cloned their repository, it is very important that you follow these instructions to join their team, rather than creating a new repository._

## Path 1: Bike traffic

The [data set here](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-east-river-bicycle-crossings) gives information on bike traffic across a number of bridges in New York City. In this path, the analysis questions we would like you to answer are as follows:

1. You want to install sensors on the bridges to estimate overall traffic across all the bridges. But you only have enough budget to install sensors on three of the four bridges. Which bridges should you install the sensors on to get the best prediction of overall traffic?
2. The city administration is cracking down on helmet laws, and wants to deploy police officers on days with high traffic to hand out citations. Can they use the next day's weather forecast to predict the number of bicyclists that day? 
3. Can you use this data to predict whether it is raining based on the number of bicyclists on the bridges?
   
## Path 2: Student performance related to video-watching behavior

`behavior-performance.txt` contains data for an online course on how students watched videos (e.g., how much time they spent watching, how often they paused the video, etc.) and how they performed on in-video quizzes. `readme.pdf` details the information contained in the data fields. In this path, the analysis questions we would like you to answer are as follows:

1. How well can the students be naturally grouped or clustered by their video-watching behavior (`fracSpent`, `fracComp`, `fracPaused`, `numPauses`, `avgPBR`, `numRWs`, and `numFFs`)? You should use all students that complete at least five of the videos in your analysis.
2. Can student's video-watching behavior be used to predict a student's performance (i.e., average score `s` across all quizzes)? This type of analysis could ultimately save significant time by avoiding the need for tests. You should use all students that complete at least half of the quizzes in your analysis.
3. Taking this a step further, how well can you predict a student's performance on a *particular* in-video quiz question (i.e., whether they will be correct or incorrect) based on their video-watching behaviors while watching the corresponding video? You should use all student-video pairs in your analysis.

## Path 3: Purdue IronHacks Covid 19 [Challenge](https://ironhacks.com/covid19)

This is an exciting new data science challenge series being hosted by the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) here at Purdue! This Summer 2020 they are launching the first Global COVID-19 Data Science Challenge - powered by IronHacks! It is a multiphase data science hacking competition run by the team at the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI). This special IronHacks is an opportunity for you to make real-world impact that affects the lives of our policymakers and citizens in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic! Leaders in our country who are responsible for protecting our citizens' welfare and health face difficult questions, such as: When and where do citizens expose themselves and others the most to COVID-19 risk? Which regions and industries are predicted to suffer the most from COVID-19, both economically as well as socially?

The IronHacks platform offers participants a no setup programming environment and many powerful features to create novel and useful models and visualizations, such as a Jupyter notebook lab environment, along with an individual and a community dashboard to assess your performance, receive tips for improvement, and learn from others. The platform supports a multiphase and digitally-enabled hacking process that augments a participantâ€™s ability to produce the best solutions they can! You can make an impact on communities through data visualization and predictive modeling during the pandemic while having the chance to get your model featured publicly to support real-time decision making.

For the purpose of grading in this course, given the deadline is the 3rd of August, you will need to submit a report of your work, description on the data and techniques used to solve the problem (as per the specifications in the next section). The tools needed to be successful in this challenge have been introduced to you throughput this course and additional information will be available by the IronHacks team as the challenge progresses.

Please note: ECE 20875 is not associated with this challenge but rather the knowledge obtained from this course should be help you be successful in this venture. 
To be involved you would need to register at www.ironhacks.com/covid19 and sign-up for the COVID-19 Data Science Challenge. You should also fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelfanHiXGrHqNrwTQdtC3EqVXP4lu0O79dS__2udz74gSoeA/viewform) to help us record your participation better.


## What to turn in
You must turn in two sets of files, by pushing them to your team's Github repository:

* `report.pdf`: A project report, which should consist of:
  * A section with the names of the team members (maximum of two), your Purdue username(s), and the path (1 or 2 or 3) you have taken.
  * A section describing the dataset you are working with.
  * A section describing the analyses you chose to use for each analysis question (with a paragraph or two justifying why you chose that analysis and what you expect the analysis to tell you).
  * A section (or more) describing the results of each analysis, and what your answers to the questions are based on your results. Visual aids are helpful here, if necessary to back up your conclusions. Note that it is OK if you do not get "positive" answers from your analysis, but you must explain why that might be.

* All Python `.py` code files you wrote to complete the analysis steps.
